# Introduction to Currying

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Instead of taking all arguments at once, a curried function takes one argument and returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments are provided.

This technique is particularly useful for creating reusable and partially applied functions, improving code readability, and enabling functional composition.

## Example: Calculating Volume

Let's understand currying with an example. Below is a function to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism:

```javascript
function calculateVolume(length) {
    return function(width) {
        return function(height) {
            return length * width * height;
        };
    };
}
